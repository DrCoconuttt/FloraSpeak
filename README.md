# FloraSpeak

While numerous smart gardening systems prioritize updates, alerts, and automated watering to sustain plant health, few delve into the concept of personifying a plant and imbuing it with human attributes to foster caretaking practices that ensure its well-being.
Allowing plants to converse, react, and express themselves akin to humans, responding to factors such as moisture, temperature, and light detected by sensors and Arduino. Enabling proactive and context-aware dialogues with users through conversational AI, using Chat GPT, to let plants express their needs and respond to plant care questions in real-time.
